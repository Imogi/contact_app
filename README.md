# Introduction
This is a contacts application that was made with React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and a mock REST API. Please run it on google chrome as some functionality such as scrollbar displays might not be compatible with other browsers such as firefox or safari. So please use this on chrome!

# How to open this webpage!

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

NOTE! When I cloned this project to another computer errors occured when attempting to run 'npm start'. This was fixed once I ran 'npm install react' within my linux terminal.

# Features
- Responsive UI for interacting with contact information.
- Search functionality, narrows the contacts list to the contacts that contain information that are most similar to the search bar input. 
For example zipcodes, suites, streets, names, etc.
